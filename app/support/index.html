      <h3>The story</h3>
      <p>In the beginning there was music, then architecture, and digital art. Prototypes of <a href="http://castrocastilla.com">abstract concepts</a> which were just a vehicle of expression and thought. We felt that we had to bring all these together, and take it to the next step...</p>

      <h3>What we love</h3>
      <p>...as we were exploring new forms of art, we realized that we needed to reach the people and give them entry to these little worlds emerging from the mind of artists. We decided to build Digital Experiences, digital products that could bring into existence new feelings through technology.</p>

      <h3>The Team</h3>
      <p>So we got to work, and figured out how to make this a reality. Fourthbit was born as a dynamic, distributed team of great professionals, lead by <a href="http://castrocastilla.com">Álvaro Castro-Castilla</a>, an architect, former digital artist and software developer.</p>
